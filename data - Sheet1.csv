First of all, many social media take the information of users for their purpose. Many researches show that the companies like Facebook, Instagram stole their users data and then the information is leaked, leading to the attacking of their users virtually. Secondly, social media is designed to capture the attention of their users, making them less focused to do the important tasks. Many studies showed that employees nowadays are less productive than before since they are always getting distracted by the notification and the urges to check things on social media. Moreover, this can affect users mental health as if they are too immersed in the virtual world, they might forget the real world they are living in, leading to disturbed view of life.

From my perspective, I will say that AI has both benefits and disadvantages. First, let's talk about AI disadvantages, when AI is first popular to many people in the world, there many people who just use it and didn't realize its weaknesses. For example, AI is usually incorrect, people have to research about what AI say before putting it in use, but there are many people who dont do that. Second example is that you have to worry about your personal information's security, such as your age, name, address,... when revealing it to AI because who know that somedays the AI can be hacked and your personal data is used for making bad money. Second, let's talk about AI benefits. AI benefits in many ways, you can use it for helping planning your schedule, use it for helping use solve your personal problems, or for self study. I can give some evidences about this, many people in Reddit use AI to help them schedule your daily life, how can they balance between many things such as planning how can they do their job, preparing for the date, go to the gym, eat healthy,... The second example is that, people use AI for enjoying purposes, AI can confide with them, talking like a friend, teaching them cooking.

The statistic data from MAL shows increase in anime production put pressure to the animators and this can reduce the quality of the animation ,the storytelling and character writing.  The pressure was mainly because of the high production leading animators to faster sketch the characters and low payment happening in many of the anime companies over the Japan.

But the reddit arguments were much deeper and discussed this subject in more specific and technical ways and from more knowledgeable figures. For example, a post from the Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton, gave me a new idea about the counter argument of my claim that how AI can misbehave or even deceive humans intentionally. Even though, I, myself am a programmer and have a good knowledge of AI structure and building process, this argument made me think and reevaluate my ideas.

In other words, the AI most probably doesn't have and will not have consciousness to intentionally oppose humans as a threat to human beings. Based on the Nobel winner Geoffrey Hinton's statements, the AI can be intentionally be deceptive. additionally intention in AI concept can translate to chain of thoughts based on OpenAI's recent developments and this chain of thoughts may lead to misbehavior. However, as I have also heard from a Google NLP specialist,  discussing this level of new capabilities that AI and language models have to show sympathy and higher level of humanized capabilities is more related to the  good optimization of specialist train Ai models, and has not relation with artificial intelligence having all abilities of humans. i think people should be more concerned about the privacy and ethical issues rather than the just a general exotic fear from ai ",2,"Reddit suggestions, splitting my sentence into different parts","suggesting a new argument for the subject instead of some guidelines to make it better it would be good to also have a suggested complete sample, following reddit was very helpful but going through all the comments was hard to follow sometimes if we can have a summary in the main page that will also help ",Yes,"It challenges my arguing abilities and the way I think, I used it for limit time if  use more I can have a broader knowledge and better structure to use that knowledge when I want to talk ",Yes,Yes

The trauma can be due to lack of parental love, bullying, sexual abuse as kid, a bad financial condition. In some cases, it can lead to making people serial killers or criminal or having bad impacts in future life as an adult that. In most of the true crime documentaries, the criminals had tough childhood due to poverty, abuse, bullying, abandonment etc. If they see their parents fighting all the time, it might make them think that this behavior is normal. There have been studies claiming that pedophilia is related to childhood abuse. However, blaming everything on childhood is a bit unfair, A person's actions also depends on people they are hanging out with, things that they think are normalized, what kind of media they are consuming and how they are perceiving it. There are many factors other than childhood trauma that can make a person do criminal activities. On the other hand, even if someone has bad childhood, they can overcome it by dealing with it through emotions, therapy and other ways so there is always a way out. If someone had a bad childhood, that does not mean that they will turn out be a bad person when they become adult.

With the regulations that exist in some European countries and with high taxes for high earners most of the people end in the equal kind of living at the end but it is not like this in US based on tax levels and income levels in statistics

After reading some posts, I found more reason why my argument is right. In US the salaries for same jobs are much higher than Europe. Like one post said analysts in US start at $60K but in Europe only 28K$ for same job. This big difference makes it easier to get rich in US even with higher living costs. Also the taxes in Europe are high for people who earn a lot. European countries take huge percentage from high earners so its hard to keep money you make. In US you can keep more money especially in states with no income tax.
US also has more opportunity for starting business and entrepreneurship. Like one guy said about his startup for baby products, and he made a good money with his startup but at the same time he was so concerned if Trump tariffs plan ruin his business. so the security and work life balance would be a problem in us compared to Europe.

People might say Europe has better life quality with healthcare and education based on statistics the education in us is very expensive studies shows that even the poor people can easily go to university in china or Europe but it is not possible in US for all people. If you want stable average life then maybe Europe is ok but for getting truly rich US is much better option.

These AI platforms can have a vital role in changing user behaviour and promoting more health and more sustainable decisions. Therefore, at the age of technology and the high penetrate rate of online platforms, response AI help us to have more sustainable society.",,person11,6,6,6,6,5,6,This tool helped me be more familiar with argumentation model which can significantly improve my writing ability. It also helped me to enhance my ability to enhance the backing component of my writing by adding more statistics and evidences.,"Claims (The main idea, one has in mind to express), Grounds (Evidence given to support the idea of the argument), Backing  (Additional evidence backing up the connection), Qualifiers  (Words that make the claim more careful - scope)","Claims, Qualifiers/Limitations, Rebuttals/Counterarguments, Grounds",providing straightforward evidences for backing our argument,6,6,6,7,7,6,6,This tool helped me to check the different components of an argument to accept or reject it.,6,"
The previous studies have shown that AI has the potential role of creating a more sustainable society. If we use AI for good reasons, they can also help the people to make better choices. Although, this is very important area for AI, it is also very challenging and we need to do it carefully because just trying to promoting sustainable  acts can decrease the AI trust. Also, the one of main goal of Responsible AI is to strengthen communities by encouraging healthy and more sustainable life style, by this term I want to explain that the current AI that is being developed by the 'big brothers' will not necessarily helps humans to live more sustainable life for example the machine learning models that help business owners and governments to sell more fast food and earn more money by suggesting to people several colorful fast foods online, have trained more compared to the responsible AI that will help individual humans to maintain a good habit in different aspects of life.",5,understanding about the different component of an argument and learning more about how can we convince others.,"using other discussion platforms,  using graph analysis for finding relevant topics, providing of knowledge graph of argument ",Yes,because it can help me to improve the content of my text and increase my ability to convince  ,Yes,Yes

",6,"So my argument is that everyone that is graduating with a science degree, say for example like students graduating with genetic engineering should not be allowed to practice specialized techniques with sensitive info in a real life setting, just because a person has a title of bachelor of technology in biotechnology , we cant be sure that if he has good ethical standards and good amount of lab hours or if he is trained on a updated advanced curriculum that is competent enough with all the other advanced institutions. we can use standard metrics like specialized licentiate like in medicine to practice the education or to track the lab hours to create a central platform like Sweden's central admission portal , where applicants can apply and all the universities use the same portal to select the applicants. like this we can create a central system where every university having that degree program has to have an account and every student who is studying the same programm has to log their activity when in lab training, monitoring this will tell the lab hours and the license exam that is standardized to every student in the programme all over the country has to pass in order to get a license, this will improve the quality of the education and will reduce the number of ineligible graduates, statistics show that students with well enough lab hours perform well in real life settings such as research labs, one example for this is India's NEET exam helped bring down the number of unqualified students to become doctors  and simply because a person is more wealthier than the other. some people might argue that this is unfair , that everybody who has a degree is eligible but the real situation with  NEET speaks other wise.",5,"How it makes me think about an argument in a way that i never thought about, the components and the structure and the expression.",May be interaction time could be reduced as now people  want everything in an instant. ,Maybe,"just because it takes time to reach the end stage, other wise everything is well organised and has real potential to help people",Yes,Yes

They must  consider the fact that they need to analyze different aspects of their personalities such as their ability to communicate and network, their intelligence and understanding towards the subject of the study(based on numerous studies, higher IQ results better in advanced studies),and their execrated level of work-life balance(based on surveys, people in academia feel that they have more balanced and less stressful life compared to the people in job market) in their career. To link these, people who have better communication skills can accomplish more achievements(like publishing more papers in collaboration with other researchers).Also, when it comes to higher intelligence, obviously, they can learn more when they are intelligence. In case they doubt about the above-mentioned parameters, they can start their journey and be more informative as they go through the studies. During their studies they can get a better vision toward job market vs academia comparing varying opinions there, because sometimes there are professors who are isolated in academia bubble and also there are professors that have more fair thoughts regarding the realities of job market. Knowing all these might help the pursuers to decide in the beginning of their journey and they can choose to resign at first or continue to dig deeper. Although I mentioned IQ and networking skills' significance, they might be successful with a good mentor or supervisor during their Phd and the institutional support surely plays a crucial role! a research conducted in this regard indicates the importance of self-stem and positiveness on people who want to succeed in a job.

Based on many studies python has become the most popular language among many sectors like, universities and other industries. Due to the easy syntax, python is really easier to learn. Also, there are many resources in YouTube, Udemy and Coursera to study this language due to the large community. Also this is a really versatile language due to the large number of supporting libraries for almost every type of people. For example, Pytorch for AI, OpenVision for image processing, and Flower for FL. One disadvantage of python, it is not faster enough like C, Java or Go. Because it is not a compiled language. But, it is getting faster with added libraries . For example, nowadays python is using for CUDA programming embedded with C++ libraries as well. 
Hence, python is a good starting point than any other language  for any new person to start programming. Also it is really good for the job market in future. Many people have share their experience of Python for job seekers and other people who created their own tools like video editors and game using python but not more professional about coding.

I have read something important was from a psychologist that two of the main features of OCD are doubts and guilt and OCD was considered the doubting  disease in 19th century , these two are the hall mark of the disorder and endorsed that these two should be faced and not to be avoided and its good to support the obsessed people to face these and overcome. these people will having a extremely hard life the best way for them is by the support that their friends will give to them by not leaving them alone until they can recover by time.
